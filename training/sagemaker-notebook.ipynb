    "# Fine-tune Falcon 180B on Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Amazon SageMaker example, we are going to learn how to fine-tune [tiiuae/falcon-180B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-180B) using [QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314) with [Flash Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135). Falcon 180B is the newest version of Falcon LLM family. It is the biggest open source model with 180B parameter and trained on more data - 3.5T tokens with context length window upto 4K tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "QLoRA is an efficient finetuning technique that quantizes a pretrained language model to 4 bits and attaches small “Low-Rank Adapters” which are fine-tuned. This enables fine-tuning of models with up to 65 billion parameters on a single GPU; despite its efficiency, QLoRA matches the performance of full-precision fine-tuning and achieves state-of-the-art results on language tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we are going to leverage Hugging Face [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index), [Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index), and [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft). \n",
